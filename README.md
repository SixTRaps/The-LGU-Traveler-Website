# The-LGU-Traveler-Website
Course Project of CSC3170 - Database System. The other two teammates and me created a traveling website, which generally realize the connection between web and database.

The web template was orinally downloaded from the colorlib.com and they are all static HTML files. In order to realize the real-time data retrieve, we changed some of those into PHP files. 

For the database part, we bought and used aliyun host, which has a database system embedded. And we created our database from creating ER diagram all the way down to the data insertion.

Data are gathered from www.ctrip.com

The other two teammated of mine are: 黄琛， 何秉昊.
